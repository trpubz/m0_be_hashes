# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    - not being able to access the key-value pair with a .dot operator is uncomfortable; i.e. `myHash[0].key` is not real
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    - I haven't taken notes yet but haven't needed them up to this point
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    - I like trying to solve a problem first and I think `irb` is cool because it shows you all the avialble methods on a data type.
